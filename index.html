<h1>Hello World :)</h1>

<p>You've found me! My name is Kevin Zelechoski, and I'm now hosting my resume with GitHub Pages. Here's to progression!</p>

<h3>I am a Senior Technical Program Manager with 20 years of expertise building, deploying, and maintaining digital marketing CX solutions for global B2B and B2C brands. Throughout my career, I have fostered substantive relationships with clients and I have led countless project teams in pursuit of creative and emergent technology solutions on their behalf.

I thrive in a collaborative environment; those with whom I've worked appreciate how I negotiate and manage change, and also how I convey complex concepts in straightforward terms. These skills have been honed over many years of nurturing successful client partnerships and managing internal cross-disciplinary teams.

I am efficient and effective at analyzing complex production scenarios. I am adept at project planning using traditional waterfall and more agile workflow models. But no matter the methodology, one thing remains constant: project plans are a custom calculation each and every time.</h3>

<h1>Hello World :)</h1>

<p><i>You've found me! My name is Kevin Zelechoski, and I'm now hosting my resume with GitHub Pages. Here's to progression!</i></p>

<h4>Versatile, energetic, and adaptable SaaS operations leader with over 20 years of experience with technical program management, process improvement, and client services. Throughout my career, I have fostered substantive relationships with clients, and I have led dozens of project teams in pursuit of creative solutions on their behalf.
<br><br>
I thrive in a collaborative environment; those with whom I've worked appreciate how I negotiate and manage change, and also how I convey complex concepts in straightforward terms. These skills have been honed over many years of nurturing successful client partnerships and managing internal cross-functional teams.
<br><br>
I am efficient and effective at analyzing complex process ecosystems. As well, I am adept at project planning using traditional waterfall, (bridging with) Agile models of Scrum/Kanban, and I possess Jira project administrative prowess. But no matter the development methodology, one thing remains constant: planning your roadmap is a custom calculation each and every time.</h4>
